Some people are refused a payday loan because they are self-employed or unemployed or because their monthly out-goings are higher than their income - or sometimes because the minimum net salary requirement is not met.

Others may have bad credit such as CCJ's, Defaults, be in arrears with loan repayments even though their net income is acceptable. Payday lenders that carry out credit checks can see your credit status when they get your credit file.

So if you fall into one of these categories what can you do, what are the alternatives to payday loans?

Well, if you have a car then you may be in luck because you can qualify for a logbook loan. Logbook loans offer a secured, same day loan solution by using the log book of your vehicle as security.
